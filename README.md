# examgrades
This project is written by me: Nora Kolve. I am the main author. However, I would like to acknowledge the author of the data set I have used, my classmates and my professor in this subject, Dr James McCutcheon.

I got my data from Kaggle, it is a dataset with 1000 participants. Their gender, race, parental level of education, lunch type, test preperation couse and exam scores are included in this dataset. I have not used all the data but some of it.


My project is about exam grades and different factors that can affect exam grades. 
The graphs that I have made are: 
1. Bar graphs for mean exam score for female and male in writing, reading and math.
2. Bar graph with all the subjects combined  for male and female.
3. Violin plot of lunch type and preparation course effect on the math exam score.
4. Violin plot of parental level of educations effect on math and reading exam score.
